# Star-Fox-2D
Created for Programming 11, March - May 2017

How to run:

Download Star Fox 2D v1.1.py

Go to codeskulptor.org (Mozilla Firefox is recommended, Chrome runs CodeSkulptor slowly)

Click 'Open Local' and select downloaded file

Click 'Run' and wait for images to load (should see Line 131: TimeLimitError: Program exceeded run time limit.)

Click 'Run' again, now that images are loaded; game should work properly

Be warned: since file I/O is not supported, your progress will not be saved if the game is closed
