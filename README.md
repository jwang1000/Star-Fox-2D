# Star-Fox-2D v2.0
A re-creation of my old programming project, now using Monogame and C#.

All original features will be implemented, plus new features I wasn't able to add before, like saving your progress and doing a barrel roll!

WIP: downloads for Windows will be available once finished, and ideally Mac and Linux versions will follow as cross-platform support using .NET Core is (theoretically) simple. We'll see if it's as easy as advertised.

For the original Python version, see the "Python (Old)" folder for the code and instructions on how to run the game.
